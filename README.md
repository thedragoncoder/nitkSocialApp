# NITK Social Media App

Note: <b>As a team of 4 we have made this app. The original app is present here : https://github.com/thedragoncoder/NITK_Social_App. I wanted to make some working changes into the app like adding a back button and probably will work on it further too. So I have made the same repo here too.So please do check the original repository out. Cheers !</b>

Some of the features of this app are the following :
<ol>
<li>To make studentsâ€™ doubt solving easy and saving the pain of Event Organisers to spam the event message in every WhatsApp group and much more, this app will be the one stop solution.<br>
<li>Students will be able to ask any doubt related to studies or anything and those questions can be answered in comments of that post by other users.<br>
<li>If anyone is hesitating to ask doubts, there will be an anonymity option too where users can ask questions anonymously!<br>
<li>If anyone is worried about missing any wonderful event happening in NITK, the app will take care of that too as an organisation can register their events and that will be added to the events list that will be visible to all users on the event page.<br>
</ol>
